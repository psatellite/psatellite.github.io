% Model a thermal circuit from nodal masses
 Creates a set of first order differential equations to model a thermal
 circuit. Inputs are the nodal masses, a conductive node map, a radiative
 node map, an input node map and an output node map. The output is a set
 of first order differential equations in the form

   .
   T = aT + bq
   y = cT

 where T is the nodal temperature, q is the thermal input and y is the
 vector of measurements.

 A node map has one row for each node and as many columns as are necessary
 to specify the connections. Each node map is accompanied by a coefficient
 map that gives either the conductive or radiative heat transfer
 coefficents for the node pair. Radiative heat transfer is of the form:

            4     4
   q   = a(T   - T  )
    ij      i     j 

 Thermnet linearizes about the nominal temperature. The result is

            3       3
   q   = a(T  T  - T  T )
    ij      ni i    nj j

 where the n indicates a nominal temperature. The radiative heat transfer
 coefficient causes an asymmetry between nodes.

 Thermnet will automatically make the a matrix symmetric for conduction.
 Thermnet will warn you if you entered a coefficient twice and the two
 were different. You only have to specify the connection in one direction.

 If you want a node to conduct or radiate to infinity just input "inf" as
 the node to which it is radiating or conducting.
