 DESCRIPTION:

 The airship hull is modelled as 2 axi-symmetric ellpsoids. It has 4
 symmetric tailfins, and a hanging empennage that supports the payload and 
 2 engines / propellers. 

 The total mass is given as:
  m = mS + mF + mP + mH + mA

 where the individual mass components are

     mS: structure and all systems
     mF: external fabric
     mP: payload
     mH: Helium
     mA: air in ballonets (varies with altitude)

 In order to compute the CG and the moment of inertia, we approximate the 
 mass distribution of the airship. Several steps and assumptions are taken
 to develop the model.

  *  The structure/system mass (mS) includes the engines, internal 
     structure, and tail-fins. Solar cells are ignored. 
     The engine mass is assumed to be 60% mS. The tail-fins are assumed to
     be 10% mS. This leaves 30% mS for support structure.

  *  Each tail-fin is treated as a point-mass, with the CG located at the
     centroid of the surface area.

  *  The support structure is assumed to be distributed uniformly 
     across the hull surface.

  *  The air in the ballonets occupies the bottom portion of the hull.
     The volume of air (and the mass) changes with altitude. We assume two
     ballonets, fore and aft, are used. Each is modeled as a
     half-ellipsoid, and they are centered at the CV location of the hull,
     which is also the center of buoyancy (CB). This is done so that, when
     the ballonets have equal volumes, the center of mass of the air lies
     directly beneath the CB, creating no moment.

  *  The payload is treated as a point mass, located at [xP;0;zP], which
     is the center point of the hanging empennage. A separate function can
     be used (BalanceAirshipPayload) to find the "xP" value that give zero
     moment when the ballonets are empty. The airship should be designed
     so that this value fits within the x-range of the empennage.

  *  The right/left engines are treated as two point-masses, located at
     [xE;+/-yE;zE]. To be practical, xE and zE should lie within the area
     occupied by the hanging empennage.
 
 Given these assumptions, the model is composed of 7 point masses (4 fins, 
 2 engines, 1 payload), and 4 continuum masses (fabric shell, Helium, air, 
 structure). Each continuum mass is split into front and rear components. 
 This gives a total of 15 components. When the airship is above the 
 pressure altitude, the ballonets are empty and are thus not included, 
 leaving 13 components. 

 The "IntegrateMassProps" function is called to compute the mass, CG and 
 inertia of the complete airship in body-frame coordinates. The body-frame 
 is an orthoganal frame with x pointing through the nose, z pointing down, 
 and y completing the right-handed system. The origin of the body-frame
 may be specified as an input. If not provided, it is placed at the CV.
