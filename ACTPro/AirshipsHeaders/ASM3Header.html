% Airship Model #2

   Contains the geometric and mass properties for a specific airship model

   The following geometric configuration is assumed:
     * double-ellipsoid hull with circular cross-section
     * two horizontal tail-fins (identical, symmetric, based on NACA 1412)
     * two vertical tail-fins   (identical, symmetric, based on NACA 1412)
     * streamlined hanging gondola to house payload

   The following design parameters are specified:
     * alt          operating altitude                              [m]
     * L            hull length                                     [m]
     * D            hull diameter                                   [m]
     * ratio        rear ellipsoid length / front ellipsoid length
     * xFinA        start of fin at hull / hull length       (from nose)
     * xFinB        start of fin taper / hull length         (from nose)
     * xFinC        end of fin / hull length                 (from nose)
     * yzFinI       inboard fin width / hull radius          (from x axis)
     * yzFinO       outboard fin width / hull radius         (from x axis)
     * xGonA        gondola leading edge / hull length       (from nose)
     * xGonB        gondola trailing edge / hull length      (from nose)
     * zGon         bottom of gondola / hull radius          (from x axis)
     * rhoFab       area density of skin fabric              [kg/m^2]
     * mP           payload mass                             [kg]
     * thrustMax    maximum thrust capability                [N]
     * xProp        x-location of propellers / hull length   (from nose)
     * zProp        z-location of propellers / hull radius   (from x axis)

     x-distances for fins, gondola and props are dimensionless (with L)
   y,z-distances for fins, gondola and props are dimensionless (with D/2)
