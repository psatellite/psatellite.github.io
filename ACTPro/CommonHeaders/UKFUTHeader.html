% Unscented Kalman Filter transform.

 This can be used for the measurements or the states.
 The weight matrix is used by the matrix form of the unscented
 transform.

 The functions fun are passed as pointers and are of the form

 MyFunction( x, d )

 where x is an n by 2*n matrix of states or measurements. d is a data
 structure. If the unscented transform is used for states,
 fun propagates the states. For measurements it computes the 
 measurements. The weighting factors are computed by UKFWeight.
