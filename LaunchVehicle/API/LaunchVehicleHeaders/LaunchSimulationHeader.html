<h2>LaunchSimulation:</h2>
<pre>
 Simulate a gravity turn trajectory in 2D.

 The goal is to get the vehicle moving horizontally at orbital velocity.

 Uses RHSLaunchVehicle2D which has a 'flat' earth. The simulation can handle
 any number of stages which are set by the arrays d.mSS, d.thrust, d.uE
 and d.cDA each of which have one element for each stage.

 You vary the pitchover angle to get different trajectories. The number in
 the script gives the vehicle a horizontal trajectory (that begins to
 drop due to drag) at 53 km. The trajectory is very sensitive to
 gammaPitchover - on the order of a fraction of a degree.
