# Toolboxes for MATLAB

For our [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) toolboxes, this site hosts an API of function and demo headers and published toolbox demos.

## Spacecraft Design Toolbox

* [Spacecraft Design Toolbox](../SCTPro/index.html)

### Add-on modules
These can be added to the toolbox.
* [Formation Flying module](../FormationFlying/)
* [Launch Vehicle module](../LaunchVehicle/)
* Optical Navigation
* [Solar Sail module](../SolarSail)
* [Spin-Axis Attitude Determination (SAAD)](../SAAD/)

## Aircraft Control Toolbox

* [Aircraft Toolbox](../ACTPro/)

## Fusion Energy
APIs for the FusionEngine and Coils modules.

* [Fusion Energy Toolbox](../FusionEnergy/FusionModules)

# C/C++ Frameworks

Our [C/C++ Frameworks](https://www.psatellite.com/products/simulation-framework/) start with our MatrixLib matrix class library. Our ControlDeck framework builds lightweight multi-rate control systems. The DSim extensible framework provides simulation capability that integrates with ControlDeck. We provide a sample code library for custom control and simulation models. VisualCommander provides a graphical user interface for Mac OS X; the frameworks themselves are cross-platform. All APIs are generated with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

* [MatrixLib library API](../SimulationFramework/matrixlib/index.html)
* [DSim Framework API](../SimulationFramework/DSim/index.html)
* [ControlDeck Framework API](../SimulationFramework/ControlDeck/index.html)
* [Sample Code API](../SimulationFramework/ExampleCode/index.html)

## Application Help

* [VisualCommander client](../SimulationFramework/VCHelp)
* [DSimMananger Help](../SimulationFramework/DSimManangerHelp/)
* [ControlDeckMananger Help](../SimulationFramework/ControlDeckManangerHelp/)

## Aerospace Control

Our Aero/Astro Vehicle Control packages include spacecraft models, spacecraft control system software, and displays for VisualCommander.

* [SC Control Framework API](../SimulationFramework/sccontrol)
* [Aerospace Control Framework API](../SimulationFramework/aero)
* [Spacecraft Models Package for DSim](../SimulationFramework/SpacecraftModels/)
* [Spacecraft ControlDeck Bundle](../SimulationFramework/SpacecraftFSW/)
