# MATLAB Toolboxes

For our MATLAB toolboxes, this site hosts an API of function and demo headers and published toolbox demos.

## Spacecraft Control Toolbox

* [CubeSat Toolbox](../CubeSat/index.html)
* [SCT Professional Edition](../SCTPro/index.html)

### Add-on modules
These can be added to the Professional edition.
* [Formation Flying module](../FormationFlying/)
* [Launch Vehicle module](../LaunchVehicle/)
* Optical Navigation
* [Solar Sail module](../SolarSail)
* [Spin-Axis Attitude Determination (SAAD)](../SAAD/)

## Aircraft Control Toolbox

## Fusion Energy
APIs for the FusionEngine and Coils modules.

* [Fusion Energy Toolbox](../FusionEnergy/FusionModules)

# C/C++ Frameworks

Our [C/C++ Frameworks](https://www.psatellite.com/products/simulation-framework/) start with our MatrixLib matrix class library. Our ControlDeck framework builds lightweight multi-rate control systems. The DSim extensible framework provides simulation capability that integrates with ControlDeck. We provide a sample code library for custom control and simulation models. VisualCommander provides a graphical user interface for Mac OS X; the frameworks themselves are cross-platform.
