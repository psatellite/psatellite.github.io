<h2>TOMHTAssignment:</h2>
<pre>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Track oriented MHT assignment. Generates hypotheses.
   This function calls the glpk function installed by GLPKMEX. If glpk is
   not installed an error will be thrown.

   The "b" matrix represents a stacked set of track-trees:
     each row is a different path through a track-tree;
     each column is a different scan;
     values in matrix are index of measurement for that scan.
 
   A valid hypothesis is a combination of rows of b (a combination of
   track-tree paths), such that the same measurement is not repeated.
 
   Solution vector "x" is 0|1 array that selects a set of track-tree-paths.
 
   Objective is to find the hypothesis that maximizes total score.

   Form:
   d = TOMHTAssignment( trk, M, glpkParams );

   ------
   Inputs
   ------
   trk         (.)       Data structure array of track information
                         From this data we will obtain:
   b           (nT,nS)   Matrix of measurement IDs across scans
   trackScores (1,nT)    Array of total track scores
   treeIDs     (1,nT)    Array of track ID numbers. A common ID across
                             multiple tracks means they are in the same
                             track-tree.
   M           (1,1)     Number of hypotheses to generate. 
   glpkParams  (.)       Data structure with glpk parameters.

                     .trackIndex   Vector of track indices in hypothesis.
