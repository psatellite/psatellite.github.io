<p>Welcome to the Core Control Toolbox for MATLAB. This help documentation contains many resources to assist you in using this software. We at Princeton Satellite Systems thank you for your interest in our product. You can always find more information on this or any of our other products on our website: <a href="https://psatellite.com">www.psatellite.com</a></p>


<h2>Requirements<a name="1"></a></h2>
<p>MATLAB 2014b at a minimum is required to run all of the functions. Most of the functions will run on previous versions but we are no longer supporting them.</p>

<h2>What's Included<a name="2"></a></h2>
<p>The Core Control Toolbox is composed of MATLAB m-files and mat-files, organized into a set of modules by subject. It is essentially a library of functions for analyzing and modeling control systems. Four modules, Common, Dynamics, Electrical, and Math are referred to together as the Core Control Toolbox.</p>

<p>The Core Control Toolbox provides you with sophisticated algorithms for control system design and estimation that have been used for cutting edge designs for over twenty years! The toolbox provides you with simulation tools, analysis functions and graphics to make your job easier. Numerous demos are provided and most functions have built-in demos. Full source code is provided to allow you to customize any function as needed and to fully understand what each function is doing! Functions for Imaging and Wind Turbine Control can be purchased as separate Add-on modules. The Common, Electrical and Math modules are also included in our Aircraft and Spacecraft toolboxes.</p>

<p>The table below lists the included modules and their contents. Many of the modules included are interdependent on other modules, so be cautious when tampering with the organization structure.</p>

<h3>Core Toolbox</h3>
<table class="cl" width="600">
<tr><td class="module"> Common</td><td class="bio">
    Coordinate transformations, control, Kalman filters, time conversions, graphics and general utilities.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="module"> Dynamics</td><td class="bio">
    Models and simulations for a variety of dynamical systems are included as examples. These include a model of plasma vertical positioning in a Tokamak, simulation of a batch chemical reactor, simulation of continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR) in series, and simulation of permanent magnet synchronous motor.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="module"> Electrical</td><td class="bio">
    Models and simulations for electrical components, motors, solar cells, and wire guages.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="module"> Math</td><td class="bio">
    Additional tools for analysis, grid searches, detection filters, integration, linear algebra, probability, numerical methods, and trigonometry.</td></tr>
