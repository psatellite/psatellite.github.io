<p>The Core Control Toolbox is composed of MATLAB m-files and mat-files, organized into a set of modules by subject. It is essentially a library of functions for analyzing and modeling control systems. Four modules, Common, Dynamics, Electrical, and Math are referred to together as the Core Control Toolbox. </p>
    
<p>The Core Control Toolbox provides you with sophisticated algorithms for control system design and estimation that have been used for cutting edge designs for over twenty years! The toolbox provides you with simulation tools, analysis functions and graphics to make your job easier. Numerous demos are provided and most functions have built-in demos. Full source code is provided to allow you to customize any function as needed and to fully understand what each function is doing!  Functions for Imaging and Wind Turbine Control can be purchased as separate Add-on modules. The Common, Electrical and Math modules are also included in our Aircraft and Spacecraft Packages. </p>
<p>The four CCT modules are described in the following table. </p>
