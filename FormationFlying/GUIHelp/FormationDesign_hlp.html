%%  Formation Design GUI
%
%   Since version 7.   
%%  Introduction
%  This tool enables you to simultaneously design the geometry and 
%  organize the team structure of a spacecraft formation. It supports
%  formations in circular or eccentric orbits about a central body. 
%
%  The GUI is divided into two windows. The right-side window shows 
%  the trajectories of the specified satellites in the relative frame.
%
%  The left-side window is organized into the following 6 control panels:
%     - Satellite
%     - Orbit Data
%     - Geometry
%     - Team Structure
%     - Display
%     - Relative State
%
%  The usage of each panel is covered in individual sections of this
%  help file.
%
%%  Team Roles and Organization
%
%  The FormationDesign GUI may be used to organize a satellite cluster 
%  into teams. 
%
%  Every member of a team has a role. One satellite serves as the
%  "reference", which defines the origin of that team's relative frame. All
%  other team members are considered "relatives". In addition, one of the
%  satellites serves as the team captain. Because it does not impact the 
%  formation geometry, however, the role of captain is not included in 
%  the GUI.
%
%  Several teams may be "bridged" together by letting the relative of one 
%  team also serve as the reference of another team. When bridging teams
%  together, it is important to avoid circular references. Logical checking
%  is performed by the GUI to ensure that this does not occur.
%
%%  The 6 Control Panels
%
% * _Satellite:_
%  The individual unit of the cluster is a satellite. Satellites may be 
%  added to or removed from the cluster at any time by using the "Add" 
%  and "Remove" buttons in this panel.
%
%  Each satellite is identified by a unique integer ID number. This number 
%  is assigned when the satellite is added to the cluster. 
%
%  At any given time, ONE SATELLITE in the cluster is selected. The selection
%  is made using the pull-down menu located at the top of this panel. The 
%  information displayed in the "Geometry" and "Relative State" panels 
%  corresponds to the selected satellite.
%
%  You may wish to assign the selected satellite to a team. To do so, push 
%  the "Assign To Team" button. You will be shown a list of candidate teams.
%  If the selected satellite is already on a team, the current team is not 
%  included in the list of candidates. In addition, some logical checking is
%  done to prevent circular references. In particular, if the selected satellite
%  is a reference for a team, then only those teams that are NOT BELOW it are 
%  shown. 
%
%  Once a team is selected, the satellite is then assigned to that team, and
%  the GUI displays are updated. The "Team Structure" panel is modified to 
%  reflect the change, the Team and Reference display in the "Satellite" panel
%  are changed, and the trajectory for the selected satellite is recomputed 
%  and plotted.
%
% * _Orbit Data:_
%  A single reference orbit is defined for the cluster. The orbital 
%  elements may be entered in this panel. Either the mean or true 
%  anomaly may be used.
%
%  The elements may be changed at any time. Changing any of the elements 
%  OTHER than the mean/true anomaly will cause the entire relative 
%  trajectory to change. Changing just the mean/true anomaly will simply 
%  change the current location of the satellite on its relative trajectory.
%
%  The relative trajectories for the cluster will not be recomputed 
%  automatically after changing the reference orbit. They will be recomputed
%  only when the "Update All" button is pushed in the "Geometry" panel.
%
% * _Geometry:_
%
%  Every satellite has a relative trajectory. The trajectory is defined by
%  a set of geometric parameters, which can be entered in this panel.
%
%  Once a satellite is selected, its geometric parameters are displayed.
%  The parameter set is summarized below:
%     + y0        Along-track (y) center of in-plane motion 
%     + xMax      Maximum radial amplitude
%        - nu     True anomaly at which xMax occurs
%     + zMax      Maximum cross-track amplitude
%        - nu     True anomaly at which zMax occurs
%
%  The parameter set may be used to define the relative motion with respect
%  to either the cluster reference or the team reference. The choice of 
%  reference may be made by using the pull-down menu near the bottom of 
%  this panel. The "Team" option may be selected only if the satellite is a 
%  member of a team.
%
%  When you are satisfied with your changes to the geometry, press the 
%  "Update" button. This will cause two things to happen:
%     1) The relative state will be updated and displayed
%     2) The relative trajectory will be recomputed and plotted
%
%  Push the "Update All" button if you would like to update ALL of the 
%  satellite's trajectories at once. This should be done if you have made 
%  changes to the "Orbit Data" panel.
%
% * _Team Structure:_
%
%  This panel allows you to create and delete teams, and it shows the
%  overall team structure.
%
%  Press the "Create" button to create a new team. You will be asked 
%  to choose a satellite to be the reference. Only those satellites in the 
%  cluster that are NOT ALREADY a reference may be selected. Once you have
%  chosen a reference, you must then enter a team name. Any alpha-numeric 
%  string is acceptable. Do not enter single quotes in the name.
%
%  Once you have created a team, it will be shown in the hierarchical list
%  at the top of the panel. Clicking on the team will show the ID numbers
%  of all members. The reference is shown with (R) beside it.
%
%  You may view a graphical representation of the team structure by 
%  pressing the "VIEW" button. It will bring up a new window that displays
%  each team according to its hierarchical level in the cluster.
%
%  If one or more teams exist, you may assign satellites to teams from
%  the "Satellite" panel.
%
%
% * _Display:_
%
%  The "Display" panel gives you several options for affecting how the
%  relative trajectories are plotted.
%
%  You can choose to plot just the selected satellite, all of the 
%  satellites on its team, or the entire cluster. Do this by using the
%  radio buttons in the "Plot" sub-panel.
%
%  You can quickly snap the view of the axes to one of four 2D planes. 
%  Just use the four buttons in the upper-right-hand corner of the panel.
%
%  You can animate the motion of all displayed satellites over the course
%  of one orbit by pressing the "Animate" button.
%
%  Finally, you can change the origin of the displayed relative frame by 
%  using the Reference pull-down menu. Either the Cluster or the Team 
%  reference may be chosen.
%
% * _Relative State:_
%
%  The relative state may be viewed as either orbital element differences,
%  or as Hill's frame position and velocity. The relative state shown is 
%  directly related to the geometric parameters entered in the "Geometry"
%  panel.
%
%%  Zooming
%
%  You can zoom in and out of the plot by using shortcut keys. 
%
%  CTRL + I will zoom in.
%
%  CTRL + O will zoom out.
%
%  This can be useful when adding a trajectory that is much bigger than
%  the original axes.
