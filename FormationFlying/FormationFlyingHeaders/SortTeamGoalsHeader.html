% Sort the team goals with fixed states listed before variable states.

   The team goals structure consists of an array of geometric and constraint
   data structures, corresponding to a set of unique target states.

   The ground may supply goals with the target states listed in any order. 
   The software, however, must have them sorted in a particular order. Thus, 
   as soon as the team goals are received by the captain, they are sorted 
   such that all fixed states are listed before any variable states.

   Since version 7.
