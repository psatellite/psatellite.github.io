<h1><a class="anchor" name="support">Support</a></h1>MatrixLib has been extensively tested, and is in use with many calculation-intensive engineering applications. However, if you feel that you have found a bug, we want to hear from you. In order to provide effective technical support, we need detailed information from you about the nature of your problem. This information includes:<p>
<ul>
<li>
The date of and name under which purchase was made. </li>
<li>
The version of MatrixLib you are using - check the top of the header "matrix.h" for ML_VERSION_STRING. </li>
<li>
The operating system you are using. </li>
<li>
What kind of hardware you are using. </li>
<li>
Whether or not you are using LAPACK/BLAS. </li>
<li>
Are you using a binary installation of MatrixLib or working with the source? </li>
</ul>
<p>
Then describe your "bug". Make sure you tell us: <ul>
<li>
Is this a compile error, a run-time error (crash), or a data error (incorrect calculation) </li>
<li>
Can you regularly reproduce the error? </li>
<li>
Provide the source code (or a useful subset) that causes the error. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Send all of this information via email to <a href="mailto:support@psatellite.com">support@psatellite.com</a>. One of our software engineers will respond to confirm reciept of your email, and then investigate the problem. We will request additional information if necessary, and provide you with either:<p>
<ul>
<li>
A work-around that achieves the desired result without causing the error. </li>
<li>
An updated binary (or source code distribution as appropriate) if the error is in MatrixLib and no work-around is possible. </li>
<li>
Assistance identifying the reason for the error if it is in your own code. </li>
</ul>
