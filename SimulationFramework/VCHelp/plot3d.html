<p>
The Plot (3D) display presents 3x1 matrices as lines moving through time in 3D.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Creation</h3>
<p class=info>
To create a Plot (3D) display, simply drag it onto a page. Once in place, 3x1 matrices can be dragged onto it for display.
</p>
</div>
<div class=info>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p class=info>
The topmost set of controls in the configurator sheet allow full configuration of the colors used to draw the graph- background, text, major and minor tick lines.
</p>
<p class=info>
Below the color options, the three planar projections can be turned on and off independently. When a projection is enabled, each graphed line will also show its projection onto the chosen plane, drawn in a lighter color against the tick-line wall behind the main 3D graph.
</p>
<p class=info>
The next two options, "Show Full History" and "Show last __ seconds" allow for control over the amount of data displayed in the graph. When Show Full History is checked, the second input box becomes disabled; the graph will show all available history. However, it's important to note that the graph only displays a sample of the data from the full available time range- it may not draw every single data point as this would be prohibitive for both performance and memory consumption.
</p>
<p class=info>
If Show Full History is not checked, the "Show last __ seconds" input allows you to specify a number of seconds of history that will be shown. As above, it's important to remember that only a sampling of the data in this range may be shown, if there are more than 500 data points in that range.
</p>
</div>

<div class=info><h3>Usage</h3>
<p class=info>
The Plot (3D) display has few options but is very simple to use. Simply drag 3x1 matrix data points onto the display to show them as lines moving through time. A small set of configuration options allow you to show or hide planar projections, to change the colors used for drawing, and to change the amount of history displayed. The display will automatically rescale to encompass the data being displayed.
</p>
<p class=info>
The Plot (3D) display is a full 3D OpenGL display, and provides full camera control. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Hold down the left mouse button and drag to pan around the 0,0,0 point.
</p>
<p class=info>
The displays also provides some keyboard control when the following keys are pressed:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b> Orient the graph to look down the X axis at the Y-Z plane.
<li><b>y</b> Orient the graph to look down the Y axis at the X-Z plane.
<li><b>Z</b> Orient the graph to look down the Z axis at the X-Y plane.
<li><b>+</b> Zoom in on the graph.
<li><b>-</b> Zoom out from the graph.
<li><b>r</b> Reset the graph to the default orientation.
