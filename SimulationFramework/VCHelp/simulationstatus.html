<p>
The Simulation Status display shows current status and allows some control over a DSim Data Source session.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Creation</h3>
<p class=info>
To create a Simulation Status display, drag it from the Tools window onto an open area of an interface page. The display will appear, along with a message indicating that configuration is required. Simulation Status displays do not accept data points of any sort, and will not allow data to be dropped onto them.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p class=info>
The Simulation Status display requires configuration before it can actaully be used. Once the display is created, bringing up the configuration sheet provides the few options available.
<ul>
<li> <b>Session Name</b> - This field must be set to the name of the Session that this display should monitor and control. If the given name does not match any existing DSim Data Source session, the display will do nothing; however, this name can be configured before the session is started and the display will automatically begin monitoring any matching session. </li>
<li> <b>Label</b> - By default, the display will show the session name in the upper left corner. To show a different label instead, put the desired text in this box. </li>
<li> <b>Font</b> - Choose the font for the text in the display. Font size cannot be controlled at this time. Use the color picker to the right of the font menu to set the text color.</li>
<li> <b>Hide Session Name/Label</b> - When this is checked, the session name or label will not be displayed in the upper right corner of the display.</li>
<li> <b>Date Resolution</b> - The two menus here (Coarse and Fine) allow selection of the format for the date. Coarse sets the most-coarse time to be displayed; Fine sets the most fine. For example, if you wanted the time display the current hour, minute and second only, you would select "Hours" for the Coarse menu and "Seconds" for the Fine menu.</li>
<li> <b>Show Extended Status</b> - When this is checked, the display will draw only the session name/label (if not hidden), the current simulation time, and the elapsed time progress bar; the timestep/scale controls and status will be hidden.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class=info><h3>Usage</h3>
<p class=info>
Once a Simulation Status display is configured, it will automatically monitor any DSim Data Source session with the configured name. When one is present, the current simulation time will be presented in the upper right corner and the simulation elapsed time will be presented to the right of the progress bar. The progress bar itself will, if the simulation has a specified end time, show simulation progress toward that end time.</b>

<p class=info>
Below the progress bar, the simulation's timestep and time scaling factor are presented. The scaling factor can be changed by entering an appropriate number in the provided box and clicking the "Set Scale" button; the change will be sent to the session as a command and acted upon.</p>

<p class=info>
The display also presents the "Quick Reset" button, which causes the simulation to immediately reset back to its initial state and wait to be told to start again (use a Session Manager or the Data window to do that). Unlike the Session Manager or Data window's reset feature, however, this reset button does not destroy and recreate the session- instead, the session's run number is incremented and the existing session is used.
