<h1><a href="./index.html"><img src="logo.png" height="32px;" style="margin-bottom:-11px;"></a>Expression Processor</h1>
<p>
This page briefly describes the Expression Processor, which is a built-in component 
of VisualCommander that allows the user to enter and evaluate simple scripts
in a single code editing window.  The user may associate input Data Points with local variable names, and then use these names in the code.
Using the expressions in the code, the user can then create new output data points.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Creation</h3>
<p>
To create a new Expression Processor, select Processors from the menu in the Tools window. You will see the built-in items  "Basic", "Matrix", "Quaternion", and "Script". Click the triangle next to Script
and drag "Expression Evaluator" to the window. It will open the Data Flow window.
</p>
</div>

<div class=info><h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
Double click on the icon in the Data Flow window. The window has three tabs, corresponding to the three major tasks associated with setting up a processor. The first tab, "Inputs", is where you can set up the data points that the processor uses for input values. In addition to any inputs that are set up, a "time" input is always available within the script which will contain the current UNIX timestamp (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).
</p>
<h4>Inputs</h4>
<p>
All input points are associated with an alias; that alias is the name by which the value of the input can be referenced within the script. To add an input, drag a data point from the Data window onto the Inputs table. Once the input is added, set the desired alias, which must be a valid matla variable name. Inputs can also be removed by clicking the "-" button below the table.
</p>
<p>
The inputs tab also contains the control for changing the update rate of the processor. Only a fixed rate is currently supported; use this field to specify how often the processor should run and produce new output values.
</p>
<h4>Outputs</h4>
<p>
The outputs tab allows you to create the outputs to which you will assign values within your script. Clicking the small "+" button below the main table will open a sheet that allows you to specify the location that the new output should appear within the data hierarchy, and to give it a name. The output will initially be given an alias identical to the name you gave the output; this can be changed by double-clicking the name in the alias column.
</p>
<p>
Details of the currently selected output are found in the fields below the main table. It is important to note, first, the "Finalized" checkbox. When this is checked, the output is fully created and can no longer be substantially modified, so it is important to be certain of the output's setup before clicking this box. However, it must be checked before the output can be used in a script.
</p>
<p>
In addition to finalization, the detail allows the type, units, description and attributes of the output to be set. The Rows and Columns parameters are relevant only to matrices.
</p>
<h4>Script</h4>
<p>
The Script tab is very simple: the top box provides space for the script to be entered; the bottom provides logged messages of warnings or errors. The "Check Syntax" button does a syntax check on the code; if the code passes the syntax check, the "Enabled" checkbox will become available to check. When that box is checked, the processor will be active and will produce data. When an error occurs, the processor will automatically disable and a description of the error will print in the bottom text box.
</p>
<p>
The acceptable syntax for the processor is described below. The important point relative to the processor is the presence of variables for each input and output alias set up in the Inputs and Outputs tab. All inputs are available via their alias, and and Output's value can be set simply by assigning to their alias. Any output not assigned to will not have its value set for that update period.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Language Details</h3>
<p>
This section describes the language features of the Expression Processor. 
</p>
<p>
The reserved words, built-in variables, data types, statements, operators, and built-in functions of this language are described next. 
</p>
<h4>Reserved words</h4>
<p>
The following words are reserved, and cannot be used as variable names.   <tt>break</tt>, <tt>case</tt>, <tt>catch</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>, <tt>else</tt>, <tt>elseif</tt>, <tt>end</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>function</tt>, <tt>global</tt>, <tt>if</tt>, <tt>otherwise</tt>, <tt>persistent</tt>, <tt>return</tt>, <tt>switch</tt>, <tt>try</tt>, and <tt>while</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The following reserved words are not currently supported.  They will be recognized as tokens, but will not parse correctly:  <tt>case</tt>, <tt>catch</tt>, <tt>elseif</tt>, <tt>function</tt>, <tt>global</tt>, <tt>otherwise</tt>, <tt>persistent</tt>, <tt>return</tt>, <tt>switch</tt>, and <tt>try</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Implementation notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>try-catch</tt> is not implemented
<li><tt>elseif</tt> is not implemented (but can be done with nested <tt>if-then-else</tt> statements)
<li><tt>switch-case-otherwise</tt> is not implemented (but can be done with nested <tt>if-then-else</tt> statements)
<li>user-defined <tt>function</tt>s (and the associated <tt>return</tt>) are not supported
<li>functions (user-defined and built-in) can only return single values (matrices or doubles)
<li>all variables are global in scope, and symbols are first searched for in the data base associated tables
<li><tt>persistent</tt> variables are not supported
</ul>

<p>
Free-form syntax is implemented. Statement separators are usually optional (see below for exceptions), statements can span multiple lines, and one line can contain multiple statements.  When defining matrices, either semicolons or line breaks can signify the start of new rows.
</p>
<h4>Built-in variables</h4>
<p>
The following variable and value names are special, and cannot be assigned new values:  <tt>ans</tt>, <tt>eps</tt>, <tt>intmax</tt>, <tt>intmin</tt>, <tt>realmax</tt>, <tt>realmin</tt>, <tt>pi</tt>, <tt>i</tt>, <tt>j</tt>, <tt>inf</tt>, <tt>nan</tt>, <tt>computer</tt>, <tt>version</tt>, <tt>false</tt>, and <tt>true</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The following variable and value names are not supported.  They will also be recognized as tokens, but will not parse properly:  <tt>ans</tt>, <tt>i</tt>, <tt>j</tt>, <tt>computer</tt>, and <tt>version</tt>.
</p>

<h4>Data types</h4>
<p>
The Expression Processor language currently supports real double (IEEE 754 floating point double precision values), one- and two-dimensional matrices of doubles, and boolean (<tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>).  Character strings, single-precision floating point values, and strictly integer values are not supported.
</p>

<h4>Statements</h4>
<p>
The following statement types are supported in the Expression Processor:
</p>

<ul>
<li><it> statement block</it>:  A statement block is a sequence of statements, separated by spaces, semicolons, or commas (no distinction is made in the Expression Processor, since no textual output is generated).  The value of a statement block is the value of the last statement it contains.
<li><it> expression</it>:  An expression is any valid expression.  Some examples include variable names, constants, function calls (to built-in or (later) user-defined functions), or matrix accesses (single elements, or submatrices, using 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, or linear indexing).
<li><it> assignment</it>:  An assignment statement gives a variable a new value.  Any old value is overwritten.  The left hand side of an assignment can be a variable, or a submatrix (single element, or submatrix).  The value of the assignment is the value assigned to the left-hand side.
<li><it> for/while loop</it>:  A for/while loop iterates over a statement block zero or more times.  The value of a loop is the value of the last iteration of the statement block (or a special null value if no iterations occur).  A maximum loop iteration count is implemented to prevent infinite loops (currently set to 10000).
<li><it>if statement</it>:  An if statement evaluates its boolean expression, and executes its true statement block if true.  It can optionally execute its false statement block if the boolean expression is false.  The return value of an if statement is the value of the executed block (or a special null value if no block is executed).  If statements can be nested.
<li><it>break/continue</it>:  A break/continue statement is used inside loops.  The break statement exits its enclosing loop, whereas the continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration of its enclosing loop.  The value of a break/continue statement alone is a special null value.
</ul>


<h4>Operators</h4>
<p>
Operators that operate on doubles, matrices and booleans are implemented. 
The operators are listed in the following table.
</p>
<p>
Matrices can only have doubles as elements; because of this, embedded matrices (stacking rows or appending columns) are not supported.
</p>
