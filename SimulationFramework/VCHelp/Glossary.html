    <br />

    <dt><a name='datacenter'></a><b>Data Center</b></dt>
    <dd>
    Data Centers host <a href='#session'><i>Sessions</i></a>. Each Data Center runs as a <i>daemon</i> process on the hosted computer. Each instance of VisualCommander insures that there is a Data Center with the name <i>Local</i> running on the same computer.
    </dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><a name='datasource'></a><b>Data Source</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A type of external system that provides data to a VisualCommander system, and may also be able to receive and handle commands from VisualCommander.
    </dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><a name='datasourceplugin'></a><b>Data Source Plugin</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A type of plugin to a VisualCommander system that allows VisualCommander to connect to a <a href='#datasource'>Data Source</a> to get data and send commands.
    </dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><a name='datahierarchy'></a><b>Data Hierarchy</b></dt>
    <dd>
    Tree structured organization of all available inputs and outputs. Shown in the Data window. 
    </dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><a name='datatree'></a><b>Data Tree</b></dt>
    <dd>
    See <a href='#datahierarchy'>Data Hierarchy</a>
    </dd>
    <br />		
        
    <dt><b>Data Processor</b></dt>
    <dd>
    An instance of a Processor Plugin added to an Interface which generates one or more Data Points in the Data Hierarchy. A Data Processor can also have Data Points as inputs, possibly using their data as the basis for the generated outputs.  
    </dd>
    <br />
    
    <dt><a name='display'></a><b>Display</b></dt>
    <dd>
    An instance of a <a href='#displayplugin'>Display Plugin</a> that has been added to a <a href='#page'>Page</a> and provides visualization for data. Multiple Displays can be created from a single type of Display Plugin. 
    </dd>
    <br />
    
    <dt><a name='displayplugin'></a><b>Display Plugin</b></dt>
    <dd>
    Plugin for visually representing data and receiving command data from users. Examples of display plugins include the Plot 2D and Model Viewer plugins. 
    </dd>
    <br />
    
    <dt><a name='dsim'></a><b>DSim</b></dt>
    <dd>
    The object-oriented simulation framework bundled with VisualCommander. Simulation components are loaded from libraries and are fully re-usable. Simulations are described in setup files (also known as DSS files as they use the .dss extension.) VisualCommander provides a built-in Data Source to run and command DSim simulations. 
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><a name='interface'></a><b>Interface</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A document containing a customized user interface for viewing data and sending commands. Interfaces include <a href='#window'>Windows</a>, <a href='#page'>Pages</a> and <a href='#dataconsumer'>Data Consumers</a>. 
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><a name='inspector'></a><b>Inspector</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A utility panel, associated with an Interface, that shows all of the elements of the Interface and provides a way to edit their properties. The Inspector also allows for the management of Sessions used by the Interface. <a href='inspector.html'>Detailed documentation is available for the Inspector.</a>
    </dd>
    <br />
    
    <dt><a name='padding'></a><b>Padding</b></dt>
    <dd>  
    The space between a <a href='#display'>Display</a>'s content and its <a href='#border'>border</a>. 
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><a name='page'></a><b>Page</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A layer within a window, analogous to a canvas upon which Data Displays "draw" their visual representations. Each Window in an interface will have one or more Pages. Only a single Page of a Window is visible at any time.
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><b>Plugin</b></dt>
    <dd>
    An add-on piece of software which can be developed by third parties to add new functionality to VisualCommander without modifying the original software. There are four types of plugins that VisualCommander supports: Data Sources, Data Source Configurators, Displays and Processors.
    </dd>
    <br />	
        
    <dt><b><a name='point'></a>Point</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A single output from a Session. A Point has associated metadata, such as the number of rows and columns and the type of the data. It also has a set of all of the historical values that have been assigned to that point at various times by the Session.
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><b>Processor Plugin</b></dt>
    <dd>
    A Plugin for generating new Data Points in the Data Hierarchy, often by processing data from existing Data Points. Processor plugins run inside a VisualCommander client and their outputs are limited to that client.
    </dd>
    <br />
        
    <dt><b><a name='session'></a>Session</b></dt>
    <dd>A running Data Source plugin. Sessions run within a Data Center, and are somewhat similar to a computer <i>daemon</i> process (i.e., a faceless background process). Each session has a unique name, provides Data Points and Commands, and can be in various states that the user is able to control using a Session Manager. A Session's hierarchy of data points and commands will appear in the overall Data Hierarchy contained within a top-level Volume of the same name as the Session.</dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><b><a name='session_manager'></a>Session Manager</b></dt>
    <dd>VisualCommander uses Session Managers to provide the means to create, control, observe, and control sessions. When attached to an interface, these items maintain a recipe for a Session, so they can create the necessary Session on demand as required. Session Managers provide a visible interface for a Session in the Inspection Panel's Session View.
    </dd>
    <br />	
    
    <dt><b><a name='volume'></a>Volume</b></dt>
    <dd>
    Part of the hierarchy of metadata that describes the data available from a session. A Volume does not have data in and of itself, but it can contain Points and Commands. A Volume can also contain other Volumes; there are no limits on the depth of such nested hierarchies.  
    </dd>
    <br />
    
    <dt><b><a name='window'></a>Window</b></dt>
    <dd>
    An onscreen window, the highest level component in an <a href='#interface'>Interface</a>, containing one or more layers referred to as <a href='#page'>Pages</a>. A single interface may contain more than one window.
    </dd>
