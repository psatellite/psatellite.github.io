<p>
The Indicator display gives a color-coded representation of where a current value falls given user-configured ranges of values.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Creation</h3>
<p class=info>
To create an Indicator display, simply drag it onto a page from the Tools window. Once in place, a single double or integer input can be dragged onto it for display.
</p>
</div>
<div class=info>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p class=info>
An Indicator can appear as a circular or rectangular colored shape depending on the value set in the Type popup menu in the configuration dialog. The shape can be restricted to a circle or square, or may fill the available space using an oval or rectangle.
</p>
<p class=info>
You may also choose to display the range name based on the current value along with the colored indicator. The name can be displayed beside the indicator (to the right), below the indicator, or it can be drawn over the colored indicator shape depending on the setting of the Display Range Name popup menu. The color used to draw range names is also configurable using the color swatch named Range Name Color in the configuration dialog.
</p>
<p class=info>
When the current value associated with the Indicator is outside any currently defined range, a default color is used. The default color can be set per-Indicator using the color swatch in the top-right corner of the configuration dialog.
</p>
<p class=info>
Ranges of values can be added to the ranges list in the configuration dialog by clicking the '+' button below the list. Each range entry allows you to specify a minimum and a maximum value as well as a color and name to associate with that range. The comparison indicator next to each value can be changed to indicate whether or not the specified range is inclusive of the boundary value. You can also specify that a range has no minimum value by setting the comparison indicator next to the minimum value to the infinity symbol. If a range has no maximum value, you can set the comparison indicator net to the maximum value to the infinity symbol. When the comparison indicator is set to infinity, the corresponding minimum or maximum value in the list is ignored.
</p>
<p class=info>
Although you can specify overlapping ranges, the ranges are checked in the order in which they appear in the configuration dialog. The color of the indicator is determined by the first matching range that is encountered.
