<p>
The Session Manager display allows in-interface control of a session, including automatic session start on interface open. Because its main function is to provide an alternate interface to session setup and management, the user should be familiar with the process of session creation through the Data window already.
</p>

<div class=info><h3>Creation</h3>
<p class=info>
To create a Session Manager, drag it from the Tools window onto an open area of an interface page. The display will appear, along with a message indicating that configuration is required. Session Manager displays do not accept data points of any sort, and will not allow data to be dropped onto them.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p class=info>
The Session Manager requires configuration before it can actually be used. Once the display is created, bringing up the configuration sheet provides the few options available.
<ul>
<li> <b>Name</b> - Set the name of the session that will be created and managed. </li>
<li> <b>Session Type</b> - The name of the data source to be used for the session. </li>
<li> <b>Start when ready</b> - Serves the same function as the "Quick start" option when creating a session through the data window. The session will automatically be started whenever it is created and moves into the ready state (usually following configuration) rather than waiting for an explicit start command from the user.
<li> <b>Configuration</b> - There are three types of configuration methods for the session.
<ol>
<li> <b>Default</b> - The session will be started without any assigned configurator and with no passed configuration data, relying on the session to use whatever defaults it can to start up. Not all data sources will support this. (The DSim data source, for instance, does not.)</li>
<li> <b>Simple</b> - Configure the data source with the selected configurator. A Configurator popup menu will appear listing the available configurators for the chosen session; when the Configure button is pressed in the display, the chosen configurator window will appear for handling session configuration.</li>
<li> <b>Advanced</b> - The data source will be provided with a set of key/value pairs. A table will appear allowing these keys and values, and their data types, to be specified. The keys to which the data source responds, and the required values, must be known by the user. The advantage to the advanced configuration method is that the configuration data is provided as soon as the session requests it, without requiring a configuration step by the user; when an interface containing a session manager in Advanced mode is opened, the session can immediately start without waiting on any user input.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class=info><h3>Usage</h3>
<p class=info>
Once a Session Manager is configured, it will immediately attempt to create the configured session, and will display its status in the message line. In addition, buttons will become active according to the state of the session. Upon session creation, a "Configure" button will appear if the session requests configuration; clicking on it will open the associated configurator. When the session moves to the ready state (either directly following creation or following configuration), the session manager will display a Start button. If the "Start when ready" was checked, however, the session will move directly through the ready state to the running state. Once running, buttons to pause and reset the session will be displayed. Pause functions normally, according to its meaning for the data source.</p>
<p class=info>
The Reset button from this display will destroy the session completely and create a new one. As such, it will move back to the configuration step if the Simple configuration option was picked, rather than automatically re-running with the same configuration data. Of course, under Default or Advanced, the configuration will continue as expected.
