<h1>QuaternionCalc Help</h1>
<p>
QuaternionCalc performs quaternion operations. The interface is shown below.

<p>The picker at the top lets you select the quaternion operation. Grayed out boxes are not needed for the selected operation. Each column is one quantity. These are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Quaternion transpose - Column 1 is the quaternion
<li>Forward transformation of a vector - Column 1 is the quaternion, column 2 is the vector
<li>Backward transformation of a vector - Column 1 is the quaternion, column 2 is the vector
<li>Conversion of a quaternion to 3-2-1 Euler angles - Column 1 is the quaternion
<li>Creation of a quaternion from two unit vectors - Column 1 is a unit vector and column 2 is a unit vector
<li>Conversion of a quaternion to a transformation matrix - Column 1 is the quaternion
</ul>
<p>
Enter the desired numbers into the boxes. You may use exponentional notation, i.e. 1e-9. One number goes into each box. The app will automatically unitize the quaternions and the vectors in the operation to compute unit vectors to a quaternion. The quaternion [1;0;0;0] implies no rotation (i.e. an identity transformation matrix).
</p>
<p>
The app checks for errors. It you enter something that is not a number into one of the boxes it treats it as 0.
</p>
<p>
Push Compute to get the result The result appears at the bottom. It employs MATLAB notation where semi-colons denote rows. For example, [1;2;3] is a vector with the first component equal to 1, the second component 2 and the third 3. You can email the result by hitting the Email Result buttom.

This app makes use of the <a href="https://psatellite.github.io/SimulationFramework/matrixlib/index.html">MatrixLib </a> framework for iOS. You can get more information on the <a href="https://psatellite.com">Princeton Satellite Systems</a> website.
